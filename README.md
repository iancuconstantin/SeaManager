1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have the Java Development Kit installed on your machine. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use a compatible OpenJDK distribution.
2. Install PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL database on your machine. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Ensure that the PostgreSQL server is up and running.
3. Install Apache Maven: Maven is a build automation tool used for Java projects. Download Apache Maven from the official website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
4. Build the Project: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following Maven command to build the project and download the necessary dependencies:
```mvn clean install```
This command will compile the Java code, package the project, and resolve the required dependencies specified in the pom.xml file.
5. Start the Application: Once the build is successful, you can start the Spring Boot application. Run the following command:
```mvn spring-boot:run```
This command will start the Spring Boot application, which will connect to the PostgreSQL database based on the configuration provided. You should see logs indicating that the application has started successfully.
* FRONTEND

2. Navigate to the frontend Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your React project is located. You can use the cd command to change directories.
3. Install Dependencies: In the project directory, run the following command to install the project dependencies specified in the package.json file:
```npm install```
This command will download and install all the necessary packages and libraries required for your React project.
4. Start the Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server and open your React project in a web browser:
